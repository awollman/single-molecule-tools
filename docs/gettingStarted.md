# Getting started

To get the code, either set up source control in Matlab or use git to clone the repository. If this already sounds too complicated use the following instructions to download

1. Click 'View on Github' at the top
2. Click the green 'Clone or download' button and download the whole repository
3. Put the folder in your Matlab path and unzip if necessary
4. Make sure all code is added to the Matlab path using 'Set path'
